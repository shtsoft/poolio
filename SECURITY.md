## Reporting Security Issues

We are happy if you report bugs (although we are not happy that there are any).
But if the bugs have security-implications please report them via mail [bugs-poolio@shtsoft.eu](mailto:bugs-poolio@shtsoft.eu) and do NOT use the public Github Issue tracker in this case to give us some time for fixes.
Otherwise the public Github Issue tracker is preferred.

## Publishing Security Issues

Once a patch is deployed the corresponding vulnerabilities are reported to the [RustSec](https://github.com/RustSec/advisory-db) by the maintainers.
